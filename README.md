## Overview
VRC Omni-Action is a single configurable UdonSharp behaviour that can be used for a growing multitude of VRChat world interactions and game-logic functions.

It is intended to be efficient and relatively simple to use without the need for any additional editor scripts or dependencies outside of UdonSharp. All configuration, including networking and event routing, can be done within the Unity Inspector window without the need for any programming, Udon, or SDK knowledge. That said, the source code is cleanly-organized and commented in the hopes of also being a good learning tool, and there are very few limitations imposed on the level of complexity you can achieve.

### Requirements
Errors regarding functions not being exposed likely mean you need an updated version of the SDK or UdonSharp.
- [Unity](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/current-unity-version) (Tested: v2019.4.31f1)
- [VRChat Worlds SDK3](https://vrchat.com/home/download) (Tested: v2021.11.8)
- [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp) (Tested: v0.20.3)

### Optional
Components with specific functionality built into the behaviour, should you like to use them.
- [VRC Haptics Profile](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Haptics-Profile) (Controller Vibration Presets)
- [Udon AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link) (Audio Data Input)

### Recommended
Other useful VRChat world-creation tools that I will always recommend.
- [World Creator Assistant](https://github.com/Varneon/WorldCreatorAssistant) (SDK & Package Management)
- [CyanEmu](https://github.com/CyanLaser/CyanEmu) (Unity-Window Testing)

### Setup
Make sure you have already imported the VRChat Worlds SDK and UdonSharp into your project.
- Download the latest [Unity Package](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Omni-Action/releases) and import it into your project.
- A pre-configured example prefab is included that you can drop into your scene if you like.
- Select the game object that you want to control your action and add the P_OmniAction behaviour via the Unity Inspector window or 'Component > Pokeyi.VRChat > P.VRC Omni-Action' toolbar menu.
- Click the 'Convert to UdonBehaviour' button if prompted.
- Adjust the Target Function slider to match the desired function in the header.
- Click the small triangle next to Target Objects to expand the array.
- If the Size field is left at 0, you can lock the Inspector tab and drag the game object(s) you want your function to modify into the Target Objects label to add them all to the array at once. You can alternatively enter a Size value and drag them in one at a time. (See: Notes [#6](#notes))
- Configure the rest of the behaviour's actions and options as you see fit. Each of these is explained in detail further below.

## Features
The main features of Omni-Action can be broken down into the following categories.
- Target Objects - The array of game objects you've selected to be modified by this behaviour's functions.
- Functions - What activity the behaviour will be performing with its target game objects each time it is activated.
- Actions - *How* the function is activated, be it via direct player interaction or other defined circumstances.
- Options - Additional modifiers to further customize or add functionality.

All of the following properties have hover-tooltips in the Unity Inspector window.

### Target Objects
The array of game objects you've selected to be modified by this behaviour's functions. Multiple can be added.
- There is no limit imposed on the number of target game objects you can add.
- Note that some functions behave differently depending on the number of target game objects detected.
- See [Setup](#setup) above for tips on placing game objects into the array via the Unity Inspector window.

### Functions
The primary function of the behaviour. Only one can be selected.
- Events Only - No target-object functionality outside of options and event routing (detailed below).
- Pickup Reset - Reset target VRC-Pickup objects to their original positions and rotations from instance start.
- Binary Toggle - Swap current active status of all target objects.
- Sequence Toggle - Enable active status of one target object at a time (disabling all others) in sequence.
- Enable All - Enable active status of all target objects.
- Disable All - Disable active status of all target objects.
- Animator Toggle - Toggle specified boolean variable on target objects' animator components.
- Animator True - Enable specified boolean variable on target objects' animator components.
- Animator False - Disable specified boolean variable on target objects' animator components.
- Teleport Player - Teleport player to the location of the first target object or in sequence if multiple.
- Teleport Object - Teleport first target object to all other target-object locations in sequence.
- Stopwatch - Toggle a stopwatch counter that outputs its accrued time to Text component of first target object.
If using both entry & exit trigger actions, stopwatch will start on exit and stop on re-entry. Otherwise, it will toggle.
- Object-Pool Spawn - Attempt to spawn next object from each target object's VRC-Object-Pool.
- Object-Pool Reset - Reset contents of each target object's VRC-Object-Pool.

### Actions
The means of activation for the target object function. Multiple can be selected.
- Button Interact - Activate when player clicks the button.
- Entry/Exit Trigger - Activate when player or specified pickup object enters/exits trigger.
- Occupied Trigger - Activate when *any* player or specified pickup object enters trigger, deactivate when empty.
- On-Enable/Disable - Activate when object's active status is changed. (See: Notes [#1](#notes))
- Timer Repeat - Activate on a repeated timer, either random range or set interval.
- AudioLink - Activate when Udon AudioLink data meets conditions on specified audio band.
- All-Active Scan - Activate if all target objects found active, deactivate if it becomes untrue. (See: Notes [#2](#notes))
- Remote Action - Activate remotely from another behaviour.

### Options
Additional modifications of functionality. Multiple can be selected.
- Is Global - Behaviour won't explicitly sync objects or serialize variables over the network for other players and late joiners unless this is enabled. (See: Notes [#3](#notes))
- One-Shot - When enabled, the function can only be activated one time. An optional "\_ReEnable" event can be called to reset this.
- Randomize Functions - Add randomization or shuffling to certain functions: Sequence Toggle, Player/Object Teleport, Object-Pool Spawn/Reset.
- Animator Bool - Name of effected boolean variable for relevant animator functions.
- Override Name Contains - Triggers are activated by game objects containing this name *instead* of by players, unless this field is left empty.
- Min/Max Timer - Randomized range in seconds for Timer Repeat action. For a steady interval, set Max Timer to 0 or both fields to same value.
- Delay Time - Delay the final step of functions for a set number of seconds. The delay is observed *after* Audio, Haptics, and Events have been fired.
- AudioLink - Only relevant if you are using [Udon AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link) data in your project. Threshold adjusts band sensitivity and applied inverse time throttle (<1s).
Threshold is applied on top of source AudioLink's own threshold settings, no source behaviour variables are changed.
- Entry/Exit - Functionality is split for actions that can behave differently whether they are being entered/exited or enabled/disabled, etc.
- Haptics Profile - Reference a [VRC Haptics Profile](https://github.com/Pokeyi/VRC-Haptics-Profile) to relay customized controller vibration to the player with optional falloff relative to its position.
- Audio Source - Play sound from audio source when the function is activated activated. If 'Is Global' is enabled, all other players within range will hear the sound as well.
- Events - These options enable you to remotely call public methods / custom events on other behaviours. Global events will trigger for all players even if 'Is Global' is not enabled. Events are called sequentially for the receiver on the same numbered line in the inspector array. If calling both local and global events on different behaviours, leaving an event name blank will skip it for that receiver. As an example, you can trigger remote actions on other Omni-Action behaviours with the "\_RemoteAction" local event. (See: Notes [#4](#notes))

### Use Case Examples
A few of the simpler configurations that are possible.
- Binary Toggle + Interact Button = Mirror Toggle
- Sequence Toggle + Interact Button = Low / High / Transparent Mirror Switcher
- Animator Toggle + Occupied Trigger + 'Is Global' = Proximity Door
- Teleport Player + Entry Trigger = Portal
- Stopwatch + Entry Trigger + Exit Trigger = Time Trial Zone
- Teleport Object + Timer Repeat + 'Is Global' = Hidden-Item Relocator
- Object-Pool Spawn + Timer Repeat (Random Range) + 'Is Global' = Unpredictable Obstacle Dropper
- Pickup Reset + Interact Button = Yea, these are pretty self-explanatory.

Something more complex:
1. Binary Toggle + Occupied Trigger + Override Name Contains "Key #1" + 'Is Global' = Lock #1
2. Binary Toggle + Occupied Trigger + Override Name Contains "Key #2" + 'Is Global' = Lock #2
3. Disable All + All-Active Scan + 'Is Global' + One-Shot = Two Keys, One Door - Simultaneously disable door and above keys & locks.

You can then easily add sound effects, controller haptic feedback, and additional animations/effects via events for each component above.

### Notes
As stated above, very few limitations are imposed on what configurations can be made, but some combinations won't play well together.
1. Spotty functionality and player-syncing if component is on an object that is subject to having its own active status disabled, for obvious reasons. Maybe just don't do that. Alternatively, you could use the Teleport Object function to similar effect by temporarily hiding these objects somewhere else instead of disabling them.
2. All-Active Scan action performs its function on the same target objects it is reacting to, so you may want to choose Events Only for most cases, but situations like the one detailed above in Use Case Examples do exist.
3. 'Is Global' should be enabled if you are manipulating target objects that are themselves network-synced or contain networked components like VRC-Object-Sync or VRC-Object-Pool. Non-local actions (On-Enable/Disable, All-Active Scan, AudioLink, Timer Repeat, Occupied Trigger) will appropriately be filtered to only activate once through the network owner when enabled as well.
4. Per the VRChat API, public method/event names starting with an "\_Underscore" are protected from remote network calls, necessitating use of a local-only event. Doing this protects them from being called by malicious clients and potentially breaking functionality in your world.
5. Functionalities involving frame updates and time do not stack and will override each-other with the following priority: All-Active Scan > AudioLink > Timer Repeat > Stopwatch.
6. Sometimes the Unity Console will throw a null-reference error when the Size field of an array is active and the objects aren't dropped in yet. I believe this is an issue with UdonSharp and/or the VRChat SDK that is being resolved in an upcoming release. You can safely hide these errors in the Unity Console to stop them from happening, they do not effect the behaviour in any way during runtime.
